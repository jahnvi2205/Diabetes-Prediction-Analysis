# Diabetes-Prediction-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs data analysis and prediction modeling on a diabetes dataset. The aim is to preprocess the data, explore the dataset, and build models to predict diabetes outcomes.

## Introduction

This project uses a diabetes dataset to demonstrate the process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. The notebook includes various steps such as handling missing values, feature selection, and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various health indicators such as:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (1: Diabetes, 0: No Diabetes)

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - Scikit-learn (often abbreviated as sklearn)
